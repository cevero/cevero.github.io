# [](#header-1)CEVERO

The CEVERO name stands for the acronym (or more strictly, a backronym) of Chip multi-procEssor for Very Energy-efficient aeRospace missiOns. This project aims to develop an energy efficient, parallel chip that harnesses the advantages of the PULP Platform and the RISC-V ISA into the aerospace environment. 

This project is developed under the [LAPPS](https://lapps.imd.ufrn.br/)

The CEVERO chip is being develop in our repositories. Follow the link for technical information on how to compile and execute the CEVERO.
